# Decreasing-Layer-Matrix

My first project was in the "Fundamentals of Programming" course when I was in 1st semester of my bachelor's at IAUSTB. This Program calculates an N*N matrix in which its outmost layer is filled by the Number N and each nested layer starts to decrease this value and at the end, the innermost layer is filled with 0 value.
